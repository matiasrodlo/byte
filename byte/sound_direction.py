Sound Direction Detection Module for RobotDog

This module provides sound direction recognition capabilities using a microphone array
and SPI communication with a TR16F064B chip. It can detect sound direction in a full
360-degree range with 20-degree resolution.

Communication Protocol:
- Master sends 16-bit data to slave
- Master receives 16-bit response from slave
- MSB-first transmission
- BUSY line controls detection cycle

'''
                Sound Direction Recognition Module â€“ Communication Protocol

1. Communication Format:
   - The master (controller) randomly sends 16-bit data to the slave.
   - Then, it receives 16-bit data from the slave.

   Format of the 16-bit data received by the master:
     (1) First receive the lower 8 bits, then receive the higher 8 bits.
     (2) MSB-first (Most Significant Bit first) transmission is used.

2. Direction detection:
   - The module can detect a full 360-degree range.
   - The smallest resolution unit is 20 degrees, meaning the data range is 0 to 355.

3. Operation Process:
   - The master pulls the BUSY line high, triggering the TR16F064B chip to start monitoring sound direction.
   - When the chip detects a direction, it pulls the BUSY line low (normally it stays high).
   - The master, upon detecting that BUSY is low, sends a 16-bit arbitrary command to the chip.
   - It then receives a 16-bit response.
   - Once reception is complete, the master pulls the BUSY line high again to resume monitoring.
