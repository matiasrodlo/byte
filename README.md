# Byte — AI Robotic Dog

Byte is a Raspberry Pi–powered robotic dog that brings intelligent interaction, emotional expression, and agile movement to a compact, precision-engineered design. It responds to voice commands, recognizes faces, avoids obstacles, and reacts to touch—just like a real pet.

## Features

- **Facial Recognition**  
  Detects and responds to faces using a high-resolution camera module.

- **Voice Interaction**  
  Understands and executes spoken commands such as "sit", "walk", "bark", and "high five".

- **Touch Responsiveness**  
  Reacts naturally when touched using capacitive sensors embedded in its body.

- **Emotion Display**  
  Expresses happiness, curiosity, and excitement through synchronized lights and sound.

- **Obstacle Avoidance**  
  Uses ultrasonic sensors to perceive the environment and navigate safely in real time.

- **Lifelike Movement**  
  Equipped with 12 precision metal gear servos for walking, sitting, wagging its tail, scratching, stretching, and more.
